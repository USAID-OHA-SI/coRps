## Overview

Today we're going to be learning how to create presentation quality tables in R using the `gt` package. 


The basic outline is as follows:
  *munging your data into the tabluar structure you want with `tidyverse`
  *converting your table to a `gt` object
  *reviewing + formatting the parts of your table
    *title
    *sub title
    *formatting values
    *conditional formatting
  *summary rows
  *saving your work
  
  
##munging your data
  We're going to look at a simple table that's in long format and convert to wide using `pivot_wider`
  
```{r}


```
  
  



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
