### Objectives
For our R Building Blocks session today, we will be kicking everything off and giving a quick run down of R and getting a sense of how plotting with in R with the `ggplot` package. This session is modeled after [Chapter 3 of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).

### Setup
For these sessions, we'll be using RStudio which is an IDE, "Integrated development environment" that makes it easier to work with R. For help on getting setup and installing packages, please reference [this guide](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/corps/rbbs/2022/01/28/rbbs-0-setup.html).

### Exploring RStudio IDE
RStudio may seem imposing at first, but in no time you'll know where everything is. Your RStudio will be broken down into 4 main components.

![RStudio IDE](rstudio_ide.png)

  - Source: this box won't be here when you first open RStudio. If you go to File > New File > R Script, you will see this box. This is where you can write/save or open your R scripts. 
  - Console: below Source, you will have your console. This is where all your R code are excuted and where the outputs are displayed. If you want to run a line as a one off, you can write it here.
  - Environment - moving to the upper right hand corner, you have your environment tab. This box contains all the datasets or objects you have stored in your current working session. 
  - Catch All - this last box has a lot of different features. You can see a number of tabs, which allow you to expore your directories/files, this is where your graphs will print, and where the help files are located.

### Loading packages 
With a sense of the IDE, we're ready to start working. Open up a new script if you don't have one open (File > New File > R Script or CTRL + SHIFT + N). In there, you will want to add the following code to load the libraries that we're going to use for this session (see [this guide](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/corps/rbbs/2022/01/28/rbbs-0-setup.html) for help on installing packages). To run code from the console, you will hit CTRL + ENTER. This will run the current line your cusor is on. To run multiple lines, you will highlight those lines and then hit CTRL + ENTER.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #install.packages("tidyverse")
```
```{r, message=F}
library(scales) #install.packages("scales")
library(glitr) #remotes::install_github("USAID-OHA-SI/glitr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Viewing the data
The dataset we're using today is stored in the `glitr` package. It's a masked HFR dataset that has information for FY50 on multi-month dispensing, MMD. Let's take a look at the data using `glimpse()` and then `View()`. *If you are getting an error, make sure you reinstall `glitr` using the code in the section about

```{r}
#store the dataset as an object in your Global Environment
hfr_mmd <- hfr_mmd
```

```{r}
#prints out a previous with your indicators vertically (with type) and data runs horizontally
glimpse(hfr_mmd)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#your traditional tabular view
View(hfr_mmd)
```

Each row is a distinct reporting period (date:hfr_pd) with information on where the data were reported (operatingunit:pnsu), by whom (mech_code) and how much (tx_curr:share_tx_mmd.o3mo). For more information on the dataset, we can use the `?` to see the documentation through a "help" file. This function is extremely useful for getting help files. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#get help with ?[function] or place your cursor on the function and hit F1
?hfr_mmd
```
### Plotting
Great, we have our data, now we can move onto start plotting. To plot our data, we're going to a package called `ggplot2` which is part of the Tidyverse and installed/loaded with `tidyverse`.

Creating a plot with `ggplot2` is simply about providing some basic information and building layers as you go. We always will start with `ggplot()` to create a coordinate system and then add on a number of mapping arguments or layers. So we are going to pass the dataset into `ggplot()` and we will start by creating a scatter plot using `geom_point()`. In addition to passing in the dataset, we need to provide the function with what we want on the x and y axis.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo))
```

Et voila, we have a plot! Each of those points is a site in a given month associated with the value provided.

#### Exercises
  1.  How many rows are in `hfr_mmd`?
  1.  Create a plot to explore the relationship between patient volume (`tx_curr`) and share on over 3 months of treatment dispensing (`share_tx_mmd.3mo`). Looking at the help file and the plot, what makes this plot not very telling?

### Aesthetic mapping
We have developed a basic plot with two lines of code. It's not very telling, but we can start to add layers of complexity through aesthetics. Wickham and Grolemond describe aesthetics as "An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points."

On helpful aesthetic to apply to this plot is color. We can try adding our `y` value as the `color` as well and see what happens.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo))
```

From this we can see that `ggplot` created a continuous scale ranging from dark blue on the lower end of `share_tx_mmd.o3mo` to ligher blue on the upper. We could also pass in a discrete scale, like `psnu`, which will assign color each PSNU a distinct color.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, color = psnu))
```

In addition to color, we can also pass in values to size our shapes.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, size = tx_curr))
```

Now that the points are different sizes, a number of them have been hidden because they are overlapped. We can adjust their transparency, called `alpha`, where 1 is completely opaque and 0 is completely transparent.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, size = tx_curr),
             alpha = .4)
```

What is interesting about the `alpha` aesthetic? It's outside our `aes()` mapping. What is the difference? By applying an aesthetic outside of `aes()`, you are manually adjusting the aesthetic, applying it to ALL the data values in that geom.

One last feature to flag is that we can also pass in logic into the aesthetics. Maybe we want to highlight the data points below 60%.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo >= .6, size = tx_curr),
             alpha = ifelse(hfr_mmd$share_tx_mmd.o3mo >= .6, .2, 1))
```

In the plot above, we used boolean logic for the `color`, so TRUE and FALSE created different colors. And for the alpha, we passed in the vector from the dataframe to say if the value meets the threshold of 60%, use this value for `alpha`, otherwise use this other value.

#### Exercises
  1. Using a similar plot from above where `x = date` and `y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo`, change all the data points to size 6. Repeat this and change all the colors to of the points to purple.
  1. What is wrong with the code below? Why are the points not green?
    ```
    ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, color = "green"))
    ```
  1. Use the `shape` aesthetic to change the shape based on `snu1`.
  

### FACETING
In addition breaking out characteristics of the data with aesthetic mapping, we can also separate the main plot in small multiples, or facets. In one of the examples above, we applied a different color to each PSNU to differentiate the values. Rather than having all of these values on the same plot, we can break it into small multiples using `facet_wrap()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo)) +
  facet_wrap(~psnu)
```
No instead of one jumbled plot, we can view the trends by each district. The ordering here is alphabetically, which isn't terribly meaningful here. And the ordering is futher being messed up because it's interpreting Districts 10 and 11 coming after District 1 and before District 2. We can assign ordering to our faceting using a package in the `tidyverse` called `forcats`. A more meaningful ordering may be to order the districts by their over all (sum) TX_CURR. To do this, we'll wrap `psnu` in the last line within the `fct_reorder()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo)) +
  facet_wrap(~fct_reorder(.f = psnu, #what are we ordering?
                          .x = tx_curr, #by what variable are we ordering it?
                          .fun = sum, #how are we ordering it/what function?
                          na.rm = TRUE, #should we remove NA values?
                          .desc = TRUE #should we reverse the direction
                          )
             )
```
We can also use two variables to create the small multiples in a grid. For instance, we could compare how different mechanisms compare in the different regions they are in.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo)) +
  facet_grid(snu1 ~ mech_code)
```

#### Exercises
  1. Read the help for `facet_wrap()` (`?facet_wrap`) and figure out how you would make the output from our PSNU small multiples above into 1 row? Would you you plot it in one column?
  1. How would you reorder `mech_code` order in the second small multiples graphic so that they were ordered by the partner who had the highest (max) TX_CURR to the lowest?
  
### Transformation
So far we have been working with points, but can do things more sophisticated with the data. For the scatter plots we've been using, we have taken the the x and the y mapping directly from our dataset. We can also used `ggplot` to transform our data, say creating a count or a sum, and displaying the output as a bar chart or histogram. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = date))
```

By using `geom_bar` we are getting a count of the number of rows that exist in the dataset. This could be useful for various purposes, but of more import to us is being able to sum up the values patients. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = date, y = tx_curr), stat = "identity")
```

A slightly simpler alternative to `geom_bar` is to use `geom_col`, which defaulted to `stat = "identity"` that you would have to otherwise specify to not get a count when using `geom_bar` 

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = date, y = tx_curr))
```

We can also quickly tranform this into a stacked bar chart by applying a color fill.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = date, y = tx_curr, fill = snu1))
```
Stacked bar charts aren't ideal. We could create a small multiples plot like we did above, which is preferable, but could also just dodge the columns by changing the `position`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = date, y = tx_curr, fill = snu1),
           position = "dodge")
```

In mentioning the position, it may be useful to back to our scatter plots from above. In the plots, many of our points were overlapping and couldn't be seen without adjusting the shapes' opacity. Another option would have been to adjust the placement of the points by jittering them slightly to help with the overplotting. We can adjust the position by using `position = jitter`). 

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, size = tx_curr),
             alpha = .4,
             position = "jitter")
```

You can even refine the radius of the jittering by using a function, `position_jitter()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, size = tx_curr),
             alpha = .4,
             position = position_jitter(width = 5, height = 0, seed = 42))
```

#### Exercises
  1. Plot a bar graph of TX_CURR over time. Replace `fill = snu1` with `color = snu1` in the aesthetics. What changes in your plot?
  1. Using `geom_bar` graph the number of observations for each period (`date`).

### Additional Thoughts
Before closing the book on the basics of plotting using `ggplot`, I wanted to delve hit on a few things.

First up is structure. So far, we have passed in data to `geom_` and then mapped aesthetics. The great thing is that you can keep using that simple structure and layering on more and more geoms and aesthetics. For example, we could add in a `geom_line` to connect the points and even add a static threshold line, `geom_vline`, or even an area to highlight a particular period.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd,
       mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(group = mech_code), alpha = .4) +
  geom_point(alpha = .4) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .6, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  facet_wrap(~psnu)
```

In addition to layer on geoms and facets, we can also clean up the x and y scales as well as adding titles and captions.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, size = tx_curr),
             alpha = .4) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_size(labels = comma) +
  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis", labels = percent, guide = "none") +
  labs(x = "Reporting Period",
       y = "Patients on 3+ months of Rx",
       size = "TX_CURR\n volume",
       title = "LARGERS DISTRICTS HAVE MORE PATIENTS ON +3 MONTHS OF RX",
       caption = "Source: HFR FY50")
```

We can also start adjusting the style and theme.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, size = tx_curr),
             alpha = .4) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_size(labels = comma) +
  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis", labels = percent, guide = "none") +
  labs(x = "Reporting Period",
       y = "Patients on 3+ months of Rx",
       size = "TX_CURR\n volume",
       title = "LARGERS DISTRICTS HAVE MORE PATIENTS ON +3 MONTHS OF RX",
       caption = "Source: HFR FY50") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        axis.text = element_text(color = "gray60"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

So far we have just been using `glitr` package to access the `hfr_mmd` data, but the package's function is to apply the [OHA Style Guide](https://issuu.com/achafetz/docs/oha_styleguide) on top of `ggplot`. Since part of the style is a non-standard R font, I am going to load an extra package to load the font. For more information on how to use `extrafont` the first time and install Source Sans Pro, see [this reference](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/glitr/index.html#what-the-fnt).  

```{r}
library(extrafont) #install.packages("extrafont")
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = hfr_mmd) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, 
                           color = share_tx_mmd.o3mo, size = tx_curr),
             alpha = .4) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 months", date_labels = "%b") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  scale_size(labels = comma) +
  scale_color_si(palette = "scooters", guide = "none") +
  labs(x = "Reporting Period",
       y = "Patients on 3+ months of Rx",
       size = "TX_CURR volume",
       title = "LARGERS DISTRICTS HAVE MORE PATIENTS ON +3 MONTHS OF RX",
       caption = "Source: HFR FY50") +
  si_style_ygrid()
```
